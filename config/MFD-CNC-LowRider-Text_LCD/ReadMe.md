--------------MFD LowRider v2 CNC Machine -------

This is the configuration for my CNC Machine based on V1 Engineering Low Rider v2

I had to modify the printed parts in order to use EMT pipes from HomeDepot 
EMT 1inch => OD= 29.5mm ($10.4/10ft)for the x axis
EMT 3/4inch => OD=23.5mm ($6.2/10ft)for the Z axis

For the controller I am using the RAMPS 1.4 with the 4 Line Text LCD 
For Power supply currently using a 12V ATX power supply but plan to use a 19V laptop power adapter later on.

The motors are NEMA17 5x17HS5415P1 78oz.in (55N.cm)  ($25.20 on Ebay)
